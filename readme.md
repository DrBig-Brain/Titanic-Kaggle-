# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Folder Structure

- `EDA.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
- `modeling.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- `model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for final model training and predictions.
- `Titanic.csv` - Original Titanic dataset.
- `post_EDA.csv` - Cleaned dataset after EDA and preprocessing.
- `model.pkl` - Saved trained model.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run EDA and preprocessing:**
   - Open `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
   - Follow the steps to explore and preprocess the data.
   - The cleaned data will be saved as `post_EDA.csv`.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Open `modeling.ipynb` to experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.

4. **Final Model:**
   - Use `model.ipynb` to train the final model and generate predictions.
   - The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.

## Requirements

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for all dependencies, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

## Usage

- Modify and run the notebooks as needed for your analysis.
- Use the saved model (`model.pkl`) for inference on new data.
